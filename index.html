      I'm a portuguese guy who loves listening to music, watching movies and series, writing, surfing, travelling, exploring new places, having drinks with friends and family dinners... I'm a tennis coach at the end of the day and a thriller writer at weekends. .. I worked for many years as a traffic manager, but I felt the need to change the course of my career and I think this Bootcamp in Web Development is what I'm looking for!
